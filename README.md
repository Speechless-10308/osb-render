<h1 align="center">Osb Render</h1>  
A simple osb render with lots of bugs and latency...

## A simple Usage
Install uv on your PC.
```shell
uv sync
```
Use the tool with the following command (to use gpu accelaration):
```shell
uv run main.py [osb_path] -o [output_path] --width 1920 --height 1080 --audio [audio_path] --gpu
```

## TODO
- [ ] An application with gui.
- [ ] Some unknown bugs maybe...
- [ ] A good looking README.

These are just some entertainment pieces I made in my spare time from research. Forgive me, my boss!!!
